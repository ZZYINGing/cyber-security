# KDD cup '99

> The KDD’99 an Intrusion Detection Dataset has 41 dimensions of data and a very large about of samples (“rows”), given that Sklearn is CPU only and that much of the code is a single-threaded, the training time is often unreasonable long. This is not a technological challenge

+ `Intrusion_Detection_Multiclass_V2.ipynb`: The best and most recent notebook
  + [Blog post](https://medium.com/@alik604/predicting-the-nsl-kdd-data-set-with-98-accuracy-240a7a245c9d)

+ `Intrusion_Detection_Multiclass.ipynb`: Multiclass Classification
+ `Intrusion_Detection_Singleclass.ipynb`: Singleclass Classification
+ `KDD_autoencoder.ipynb`: Ignore this, instead look at `UNSW_NB15 - PyTorch Categorical Variational AutoEncoder with Gumbel Softmax.ipynb` & `UNSW_NB15 - PyTorch MLP and autoEncoder.ipynb`, it is a much better example.
